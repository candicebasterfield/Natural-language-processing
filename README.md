Using the nltk package for NLP

I perform tokenization, stemming, extract stopwords, and POS tagging on Tweets.

Next I peroform text classification. Text classification is a fundamental task in NLP, with applications ranging from sentiment analysis and document categorization.

I use two popular machine learning algorithms for text classification:  Naive Bayes classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classifiy positive, neutral, and negative Tweets.
